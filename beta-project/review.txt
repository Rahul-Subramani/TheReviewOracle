  I was tired searching various phones under 10k. My priorities were:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. Low SAR ( Radiation level)
  <br/>
  2. Min 16GB Internal memory
  <br/>
  3. 5.5" IPS Display
  <br/>
  4. Gorilla Glass
  <br/>
  5. Android Lolipop
  <br/>
  6. A fast and reliable processor.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I couldn't find even a single phone by any reputed manufacturer to offer all above mentioned features. Lenovo models were good but beware, their SAR (Radiation) levels are high and just within the prescribed upper limits. So they did not fit the scheme.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Then came ZENPHOne 2 Laser 550KL
  <br/>
  <br/>
  It satisfied my all requirements. Its a great gadget. Stylish, sleek, looks expensive, performance is exceptionally good for a phone under 10k. No LAGS AT ALL.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CAMERA ISSUE:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I was a bit skeptical about its camera output after reading some divergent and critical remarks. But let me assure you, the Camera works well. ASUS released two critical system updates ( each around 300 MB). As soon I updated the phone, I noticed a remarkable change in the Camera quality. Whatever the shortcomings were removed.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Conclusion:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A great device to have. Best SAR value. Good camera, becomes the BEST after a simple auto update. Highly recommended.

Review Title : A "Zensational" smartphone...

Upvotes : 883

Review Content :
ss="">
  Firstly thanks to flipkart for their speedy delivery... no issues here..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now coming to the phone...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One word Marvelous ... truly a quality product from ASUS. I went through a lot of reviews , many youtube videos etc. and finally decided to hit the BUY button , and i'm more than happy that i did it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The PROS :
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. The looks - Fantastic looks for a 10k phone , its built well and the white back for the black front looks mature and far better than those cheap plastic lenovos, yurekas etc..... 10/10
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2. The screen - 5.5" with gorilla glass 4.. more than enough and even though its 720p it is  sharp enough and bright with very good viewing angles and the touch response is smooth and accurate.... 10/10
  <br/>
  <br/>
  3. The performance - Has a snapdragon 410 1.21 ghz soc , snappy performance - smooth game play ,no lags in usual day to day tasks  , 800 to 900mb ram always free , 10.8gb internal space available for usage and sd card can be added ,no issues with the performance in any way... 9.5/10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  4.The camera - Very good camera with lots of settings and modes (manual mode, beautification, HDR , time lapse , time rewind , low light mode and many more).. Image quality is amazing in good lighting conditions and quite good in indoors as well (sometimes grainy in indoors but not a major issue), laser auto focus is really fast and focuses accurately, video recording is very good and what do i say about the front cam... simply superb for selfies with good color reproduction... so 8.5/10 for camera.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  5. The audio - Some guys were telling speaker volume is low... i think they were expecting a subwoofer or something... come on guys the speaker is crystal clear and loud enough for call ringtones , songs and video playback. And coming to the audio through headphones -- MARVELOUS... connect any good headphone and you will enter into a new world of music.... 10/10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  6. The connectivity - Dual 4g sims and airtel 4g works fine no problems at all, wifi , bluetooth , all is well and call quality is clear and distortion free... 10/10.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  7. The Fuel tank -  The battery backup is superb --
  <br/>
  --only calls and sms (2 days).
  <br/>
  --3g/4g internet with whatsapp, fb, browsing , light gaming (1-1.5 days).
  <br/>
  -- heavy usage (8-10 hrs easily)...
  <br/>
  10/10 for battery. but the charger is a 1 amp unit so takes some time to charge.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  8. The UI- smooth ,snappy and tons of features... font color ,font style ,themes ,icon packs , wallpapers , double tap to wake/sleep, gestures to launch apps, one handed mode..... and blah blah blah.....
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The CONS
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. No cons actually according to me and don't get me wrong that i'm exaggerating or something... the phone IS REALLY GOOD for 9999... ( will update if any cons found with usage)..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thanks for reading, hope it helps.

  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pros :

  <br/>
  1. 5.5 inch hd diplay vibrant and great crisp display with an amazing 72% screen to body ratio that looks amazing.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2. Amazing battery back up with normal usage the phone can easily run upto 2 days with heavy usage it will go upto 14 hrs easily and with moderate usage it will go upto a day.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  3. A very good13 mp rear &amp; 5 mp sefie camera produces sharp and clear pics with good detailing the best camera within the 10k range and even better than samsung e6,redmi,lenovo. i personally compared the cameras with these phones and then came to the conclusion.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  4. Sound output Is great some were saying its low i chkd it for myself i damn loud with clear sound quality.Headphone output is superb too.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  5. Laser autofocus helps you to clk amazing pics with fast focus.. macro shots come out great with good details.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  6. Gesture features are a great addition helps a lot.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  7. The phone's 1.2 ghz 64 bit coupled with 2 gb ram will get you through anything. Its fast and responsive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  8. Design and build quality is also good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  9. Gaming is absolutely amazing casual games run without any issue high end games are running smoothly too games such as gt racing 2,fifa and other high end games ran without any problem tried asphalt 8 in high graphics works without any lag but i wd recommend one to play the game in medium graphics works even better.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  10. Does not heat up much no matter how much multitasking and anything else u through at this device.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Every phone have some cons no matter how good it is but in this phone the cons are few and are no of much concern to me and i dnt think any1 will have any problems with it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. Takes a long time to charge up almost 2.5 hrs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2. The camera quality is great but in night time its not that great but u will get decent quality pics no worries about that.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>

  The best Android Device Experienced till now
  <br/>
  <br/>
  we use smartphones in terms of Calling obviously, for watching movies,Gaming,GPS and lots of net stuff including social or commercial use.
  <br/>
  But these stuff you can get easily in any smartphone under 10k but the main issue where the devices lack now days, battery backup,here in this department 'its GOD' seriously.After playing continuously 35-40 min of clash of clans battery drains from 67% to 64% i was shocked literally.In same case if device was Xiaomi Mi4 it will drained to 60% or 59%,why I m comparing it to Xiaomi Mi4 to this device is because Mi4 and the one plus one both of these devices are great known for battery backup as well so in that case this Zenphone 2 laser can beat both of them very easily.
  <br/>
  GAMES PLAYED-
  <br/>
  Asphalt 8- High setting (works fine) Medium (Great)
  <br/>
  FIFA 16 (Great Performance)
  <br/>
  Need for Speed NO LIMIT (Great)
  <br/>
  Marvel Contest of champion(Great)
  <br/>
  After playing these games i didnt even noticed the heat so guys this device does'nt heat at all,even while you charging it will still remains the same temp'
  <br/>
  People here talking about the issue regarding the sound quality and its loudness-
  <br/>
  Sound quality is really nice but the loudness is not up to the mark,Dont get me wrong here,I'm not saying that its bad but it is actually low to my liking , if i would hv to rate it out of 10 I'll give it 7 to 7.5 . So it is low but not so low obviosuly you can hear the ringtones in the same room :P and every one have their secondary  phone specially for calling purpose,you just have to buy cool headset and you will love it while you watching movies or video,I'm a bass lover , m not like those who willing to listen soft clarity like sound,I have used Sony's XB450, nw XB70 (in ear) is my daily driver and was also played some music videos to check the quality of sound thru this device and i had same experience with it so in headset department totally impressed.
  <br/>
  For those who said in their review about the proximity sensor issue-
  <br/>
  from the day 1 I seriosuly hvnt noticed any issue regarding proximity sensor even i hv used a tempered glass also so may be you got the device defected :P NO OFFENCE
  <br/>
  i suggest try to replace it if your 30 days replacement warranty is still valid.
  <br/>
  Video quality and color corrections are great i too knw this device has only 267ppi but seriously when u own this device none of this spec matter the video quality is awesome even the colors were great,by color i mean white luks white they dont look yellow 80% devices lack this seriously even in my Mi4 white was actually hving' yellow tint :D
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Camer department-
  <br/>
  I  rarely used camera seriously i am not the right guy to tell you about this category but i clicked some pictures twas descent, sort of noise found when you take this picture in low light or in an artificial lights but over all not a bad camera i would say
  <br/>
  <br/>
  so finally here is my pros and cons-
  <br/>
  PROS-
  <br/>
  Camera-9
  <br/>
  Display - 9.5  (sharp,vivid)
  <br/>
  Sound quality - 9 (Quality wise)
  <br/>
  Battery- 10 (God In this)
  <br/>
  CONS-
  <br/>
  it is v.slippery make sure when you hold it you shud hv hold it tight otherwise it cn easily drop,For the safety purpose i suggest to buy a mercury flip cover fr it.
  <br/>
  Sound yes as i mention earlier its not up to the mark,This is seriously doesn't matter to me 90% ppl nw use headset and they are the best in every sound department,i hd to write some cons so i hv written this fr the public purpose hope it helps
  <br/>
  Hit yes if you like my review else no fr unlike :)

Review Title : Fell in Love with My New ASUS Zenfone

Upvotes : 487

Downvotes : 127

Review Content :
ss="">
  I would like to point out only the solution for the cons that people said here about this 5/5 rated phone for Value for money, best specification, and Light weight design. Don't Listen to the people who complaint about this phone as they don't know much about phones and usage statistics.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons Mentioned : Camera Quality is Poor
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ans: If you think you need a phone which provide DSLR quality image, buy a camera not a phone with small sensor for taking decent photographs. However dont count on MegaPixels but the sensor size, lighting conditions etc. My phone produced decent pics, which can be easily uploaded to social media sites and finely viewable on PCs. I dont want to make FLEX print Quality images LOl ;)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons Mentioned: Proximity Sensor not working
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ans: My phone is good, and its Proximity sensor works fine. If you think its not working in your device, get a replacement.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons Mentioned: Sound Output is Low
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ans: See its a device running with a software, try to press the volume up keys and adjust the AudioWizard. Still you think volume is low, are you making any DJ party with phone? If you think volume is less in Ring, get a Trouble Enhanced Rings in Wav/Mp3. eg: police siren type.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons Mentioned: Why not Qualcom 615 Processor, on this phone of this budget?
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ans:Someone said about Yureka, Mi4i etc which is having 615 processor, Yeah, ask the people who own that hand set how much battery life they are getting if they played ASPHALT 8 continuously or Turn on Wifi or Watch Movies back to back? Qualcom 410 is the best choice that ASUS made on this phone. Its also 64 bit processor, but less heating, less battery consumption. Ask people who own Intel Processor ASUS phones about their battery backup. They may also cry. :P
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons Mentioned: Front facing camera is not able to take Videos
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ans:Yeah its true, but i have a suggestion. You can use "OpenCamera" app from play-store which solve this issue anyways. You can wait for the OTA updates from ASUS, and they will solve it by then i hope.
  <br/>

  First of all I should thank Flipkart for their best short time shipment and no charge for that.(within 2 days).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Before I purchase this Asus Zenfone 2 laser I go through lot of reviews of the mobile at this price range , especially I compared it with "Lenovo k3 Note" which my brother purchased last month.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Finally I bought "Asus Zenfone 2 laser" 4 days before i amazed with this performance and features.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1.If we compare it with Lenovo k3 note at this price range it has stylize arc design on back side it gives us secure and comfortable holding.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2.13 MP Rear and 5 MP front cameras give good quality decent images at this price.
  <br/>
  Cameras have lot of features like skin smoothing effects,low light mode,perfect zooming.
  <br/>
  overall camera quality is more effective than Lenovo K3 Note and the laser works better speed focusing.Rear volume control button gives more comfortable selfie photos with the help of index finger.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  3.This mobile gives zen "Auto start manger" app to manage unwanted apps loaded into the RAM when we not using them.So the speed will increase.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  4.It gives double touch lock screen with Zen touch gesture Settings.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  5.After full charge I traveled 200 km by bus , used GPS for about 15 mins,listen to music for at least 2 hour ,watch videos for 15 mins, took around 30 photos about 30 mins,talk about 10 mins , just swiped for at least 2 hours my battery shows 35 % after 18 hours.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am not Asus supporter , just as a end user I reviewed this mobile.Hope it will helpful.

Review Title : Asus Zenfone 2 Laser is Sensational in appearance and thrilling in effect

  Guys I guess I was the first one to preorder this phone but I received it a little late. From past 6 days I am using this spectacular demon and till now I am unable to find even one trait in it. I have compared all the phones in this price range and am assured no other phone can come close to Zenfone Laser's design and this phone has surpassed all limits, display is crystal clear, call quality and signal reception is excellent and I did not have any problem in getting signals and making calls from my home where cell signals are pretty weak.  Zen UI has hell lot of features and it is lavishly elegant and is a delight to use. This phone does not look like a 10,000 rupee phone and it appears to be a much superior phone and can easily be compared with other brand flagship phones and I'm very much impressed by its performance.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am not into gaming so i have no idea on gaming performance. This whizz is super performer for browsing and video streaming. I have watched youtube videos for hours, and there is no lagging, buffering or heating problem. The Gorilla Glass display is really stunning, even the top model phones do not feature Gorilla Glass protection.  Thanks to Asus for providing Gorilla glass 4 for this budget phone.  Clarity of pictures taken from rare camera is amazing and it captures high resolution pictures without shutter lag.  dual LED tone flash with laser autofocus is icing on the cake. Pictures taken in low light are also very good. There are many more features in camera which I am yet to explore. Now coming to battery life, this phone is powered with 3000 mAh battery and for heavy users it will definitely last for more than a day and for moderate users like me it will last atleast 2 days. I watched a full 2   hours movie and I talked for more than 2 hours on IMO and it consumed only 22% of battery. First time I charged the phone and I noticed the adapter became very hot but that was only for the first time. Since then there is no heating problem. Even after heavy usage there is no heating problem.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall this is a very good deal with all these amazing features and at this price this is more than a best deal we could get. My recommendation to anyone who want to buy this spectacular demon   go for it!!!
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I am rating 10 stars to this phone, 5 stars here *****and the remaining 5 on the comments rating.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Vinay kumar you have fixed wrong tempered glass on your phone and it has blocked the proximity sensor which is on the left side of the earpiece and is invisible to our naked eyes. Just remove that tempered glass and fix the correct one and your problem will be solved.

Review Title : A phone worth Appreciation !!

Review Content :
ss="">
  Hey Folks,
  <br/>
  A bit more in this whole package than what you expect. I ordered this phone after watching a lot of reviews both +ve and -ve. And finally decided to buy it seeing its gaming performance. I had been running on my sluggish Moto G2 for quite sometime and was actually bored of the UI and the lags. Although I flashed CM12.1 on it and it was fabulous there after, but the same laginess had got me on my nerves.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I had compared Lenovo K3 note, Moto G3 and this one side by side and finally decided to go with this. All comes with almost the same hardware with bit of a difference, but Moto G3 was ruled out of my scope, Lenovo K3 Note have that dull looking screen and MediaTek proccessor and this one got a clear edge in my comparison bcz of the bigger battery, better screen viewing angle, great touch response screen, a Moto G3 matching snapdragon 410 chipset and an award winning design.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Here are few of my comments for this phone.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  starting with CONS :-
  <br/>
  1- A lot of bloatwares, you get a storage of 10.8/16 GB here. But I found a way to remove few of them by going in Settings-&gt;App-&gt;Uninstall Updates-&gt;Uninstall. Also few ASUS specific can't be removed. But many of them are quite useful, like the file manager, Notes, whether, minimovie, memo, supernotes. You can use them in place of downloading an alternate from play store.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2- 1 out of 2 GB ram is always in use. That doesn't slow the device though.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  3- Fast charging option. I put a turbo charger and the touch was gone. recommendation - do not use a turbo charger. It takes around 3 hours to charge 90% of the battery.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  4- No Headphones. But then who use these headphones. I had never used Moto G2 and X2 headphone either.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  so thats all I can see as a con, which definitely is not that big.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  and here are the PROs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1- A very beautifully designed phone. Sleek and lightweight.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2- the HD screen is awesome. Viewing angle is tremendous. A very very responsive touch. My Moto G2 use to cry when I use it while putting on a flat surface, it took lot of effort in writing something on that. This one is awesome. Using the phone by holding it in hands or putting on bed, table anywhere no difficulty at all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  3- Games run like hell smooth. I installed Dead trigger 2 (~600 MB), Asphalt 8 (~1.6 GB), Reptite 2, Mortal Combat 5, Gaurdians of the sky, Subway surf and few other small games. I had not got a single lag till date. This is what I bought it for. Also to manage the space you can all the game related data on your SD card and can move few of the games too. You can use Auto Start Manager app in the phone to curb the use of RAM. This was of great help.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  4- Battery is awesome. Simply better than Moto G2,G3, Lenovo K3. Gives fairly 1.5 days of backup with Whatsapp, FB and calls and around 8 hours with fair amount of gaming, 6 hours of continous Youtube. To test I played Asphalt 8 and it last 4 hours of continous play time, That was awesome.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  5- Zen UI is a pleasure to use, provided when you come from a pure and boring android lollopop. You have to just run yourself through all of its features once and you are done. After that you use it to your ease. I guess the UI eats a lot of the phone memory as its highly customizing. Not sure though.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  6- You will never use power button if you use double tap function. Till date I had used just once to boot my phone for the very first time.. :)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  7- Volume rocker has a great placement. Although it took sometime to figure out where it is. That placement had made the phone more slimmer.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  8- Phone is lighter as expected. I hate bulkier phones. It feels more comfortable than Moto Phones.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  9- Finally Camera is a delight in good light condition, but low light images are poor. Moto G3 have an edge for low light shots. Laser auto focus is very very fast, manual focus takes a fraction of more, but images comes crisp and clear. You have got many modes too. Front cam is cool too. Beautiful works like butter and will make sure no pimples are visible. A GOOD PICK FOR SELFIE LADIES over there. Transition via Camera to Gallery is bit sluggish,a  lag of 2 seconds I will say. But rest all is good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This is all for it. Now coming to the price point, this phone does give all you can get in 10K.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A good pick for those who love gaming, for selfie lovers and who love bit of customization. Everything is in the phone and you don't have to download any third party app, just that you need to give bit of time to get through the features.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  4.8/5 stars from me.

  Orderred phone on 19th Aug and got delivered yesterday, thanks to flipkart as always awesome :). Coming to phone , i have been using since last 24 hrs, following things i would bring to notice
  <br/>
  1. Battery performance is good (5/5 rating for that)
  <br/>
  2. Performance is smooth no lag , i was running apps , music, internet, games (5/5 ratings for that). And yes no Heating problem at all
  <br/>
  3. ASUS has provided various pre installed apps , all of them has great utility specially apps for camera (5/5 ratings for that)
  <br/>
  4. Camera performance is above good but not excellent, ASUS need to improve on that (3.5/5 ratings for that)
  <br/>
  5. Best feature is one hand operation, since many are not comfortable holding such size phone and typing sms/whatsapp etc (5/5 ratings for this special feature)
  <br/>
  6. Pricing is awesome (5/5 ratings for that), It is far better than it's competitors like Lenovo K3 which has below average camera and high sar value, and ASUS in this price range gives a premium feel considering the back over and gorilla glass which k3 doesn't have
  <br/>
  7. Only thing that disappointed me was that they have not provided headphones along with the phone, overall packing was good (4/5 ratings for that)
  <br/>
  8. GPS Doesn't work properly....(0/5) for that
  <br/>
  Rating for Flipkart and their services (5/5 ), keep delivering smiles flipkart :)
  <br/>
  Anybody planning to go for mobile phone and have budget of 15 k you can definitely go for this one, i bet you wouldn't repent

Review Title : Spectacular phone with minor glitches.

Upvotes : 51

Review Content :
ss="">
  The phone is a dual sim which comes with a removable battery. No earphones provided in the box. Now coming to the good and the bad of the phone -
  <br/>
  <br/>
  THE GOOD:
  <br/>
  ==========
  <br/>
  1) Display: Colour reproduction is vivid. No pixellation evident even if keenly observed even though it is a 720p screen. Viewing angles are also good. Overall, a great display.
  <br/>
  2) Battery Life: One word - incredible. Will easily last 1.5 days with moderate usage. Will get you through 2 full days if used judiciously.
  <br/>
  3) Design and Styling: The phone really looks gorgeous. Looks way better than the other phones in its price segment. The product description pics do no justice. Build quality is fabulous. The phone looks and feels very premium.
  <br/>
  4) Zen UI: Both visually appealing and functionally competent. Has good options for customization. Well thought out and well designed UI.
  <br/>
  5) Performance: No lag whatsoever even though it is a quad core chipset.
  <br/>
  6) Updates : Asus appears committed to deliver a phenomenal after sales support. Receiving updates/improvements through OTA updates consistently. Very likely that it will receive Android 6.0 update.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  THE BAD:
  <br/>
  =========
  <br/>
  1) Camera: The USP of this phone is its Laser Autofocus camera, but sadly the camera turns out to be below par at best. The images appear grainy &amp; slightly out of focus and the colors in the images washed out. Does the job for an occasional photo or scan but don't go for this phone if camera is your top priority.
  <br/>
  2) Speaker: Maximum volume out from the speaker is slightly low. Shouldn't be a problem though. Audio quality in the headphones is good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall a spectacular phone barring the camera. A great value proposition in all.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  P.S. : GPS using satellite only was not working (positioning though was working through cellular triangulation albeit with less accuracy). Got a replacement only to find the same problem again. Returned it,got a refund &amp; re-ordered. It works perfectly in the third piece.

Review Title : Awesome Phone in 10 K

  The phone looks quite good with the price range. The display is awesome and the battery backup is good. The ZEN UI is too awesome. However the UI might use some of the ram. My sincere request is to update the phone. We get around 800 - 900 mb free ram and things work quite smooth with the available ram. Coming to camera in daylight it captures good photos however in low light the picture is little granular. i guess its the same with other phone not to mention it is a 10 K phone. So i would say its a nice phone with good display in 10K.

Review Title : Exactly what i was looking for.

Upvotes : 33

Review Content :
ss="">
  I love android mobiles and there specifications as they provide so many features with less price tag however we can't expect build quality from cheap android device because they don't have tough protection glass and great build quality we can only expect software features from them .but after this mobile i have changed my opinion It is the best dvice under 10 k currently available in the market .some of the pros and cons from my side
  <br/>
  PROS:
  <br/>
  1.Great build quality like tough back cover and corning gorilla glass protection&gt;
  <br/>
  2.superb display quality even it has a 720p resolution .it is exactly looking like full HD display
  <br/>
  3.smooth buttery touch screen (i am not using tempered screen guard as somebody suggesting that it will block your proximity sensor .and i don't find any sensor issues with this device all the sensors working fine and great).
  <br/>
  4.Great music player with Audio wizard .it can enhance the output quality of songs mainly you can adjust base and treble according to your interest
  <br/>
  5.mind blowing signal receiving even we are at poor signal place and also great voice call quality.
  <br/>
  6.Inter storage of 16 gb .we cam get approximately 10gb of free space .and you can use this device without any sd card and save your audio files and video files in internal storage as well.
  <br/>
  7.great gaming experience .you can play almost all high end games with this device .
  <br/>
  8.Lag free Zen UI .it has so many options to customize your viewing experience and it has inbuilt ram cleaner so that it optimizing your ram efficiently .
  <br/>
  9.great camera quality however you have to know how to use it .somebody complaining about camera quality I think they don't know how to use it .my suggestion is adjust settings according to your preference so that you can get best pictures. great camera with this price tag
  <br/>
  10.last but not least its batter backup .i will challenge any mobile in this price tag they don't even give half of the battery backup of this guy .you can get 2 days of standard battery backup and one day of rough and tough usage .it is detecting battery consuming apps so you can disable them or stop them
  <br/>
  <br/>
  11.OH MY GOD how can i forget this .The main problem face by any mobile user this day are HEATING .some phone heat up very fast by doing multiple tasks like 3g and gaming simultaneously.you can hardly find heating issue in this mobile even if you use 3g and gaming at a time .you even not find warmness at back side .kudos to asus for this
  <br/>
  <br/>
  CONS:
  <br/>
  1.no i don't find cons till now .if i find  any cons i will notify you.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  FINAL WORD:comparing to lenovo k3 note,coolpad note3 ,mi4i,moto g3,honor 4x IT IS THE GREAT MOBILE .go without any second thought

  Got the phone delivered on Raksha Bhandan, a pleasant surprise!!
  <br/>
  Very nice device, very good quality. No problems so far, have been using it for 2 days. Will post a detailed review after a couple of days. But at this point of time, the device looks really promising.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Camera quality:
  <br/>
  Rear: Very good (Not excellent).
  <br/>
  Front: Superb.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Display: Vibrant. Gorilla Glass 4 is good, touch is smooth and responsive.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Battery: Backup seems good as it goes down gradually.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Design: Surprisingly, even after having a 5.5" Screen, the device is not huge. Feels good to hold. Doesn't feel heavy. Looks really premium in hand.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No heating issues so far, not even when charging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall, worth the money spent. Go for it guys!!

Review Title : My 2nd ZenFone.. I'm in love with ASUS

Upvotes : 29

Downvotes : 12

Review Content :
ss="">
  Posting this review after using the phone for almost 2 months..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Was waiting for a phone with good battery life
  <br/>
  Finally I bought this for ?9999, and trust me when I say.. I didn't expect the phone to be so awesome when I ordered it.
  <br/>
  I also got a free ASUS ZenPower powerbank, through a lucky draw, with this phone, and that too works fine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pros:
  <br/>
  1. The best battery life in Android phones ever. Can easily last for upto 2 days off charger. I would say that this is the most important feature of this device.
  <br/>
  2. Stays cool all the time. I've not seen any other phone, not heat up even a little bit even after doing heavy gaming for a long long time.
  <br/>
  3. Gesture support (Can wake up the device using double tap, can launch any app without waking the device using the gestures. I've lost the habit of using the power button now).
  <br/>
  4. 5.5" IPS display, one of the best displays under 10k
  <br/>
  5. Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protection (no need of screen guard)
  <br/>
  6. 13MP primary camera with laser autofocus (Photos were not that great at first, but the software updates made the camera superb)
  <br/>
  (Amazing variety of modes including HDR, Manual, TimeLapse, Animation, Selfie, Time Rewind, Beautification, Depth of Field, Smart Removal, All smiles)
  <br/>
  7. 5MP front camera, with real time beautification, selfie panorama and other modes(Selfies are really awesome).
  <br/>
  8. Powerful Dual LED flash support
  <br/>
  9. Extremely slim on the edges, doesn't feel like a huge device when u hold it.
  <br/>
  10. Good build and looks premium (white)
  <br/>
  11. LED indicator
  <br/>
  12. Excellent call clarity and signal reception
  <br/>
  13. 1.2GHz Quad Core Snapdragon 410 processor (Most efficient when it comes to power, and doesn't heat up at all)
  <br/>
  14. 2GB RAM - Great multitasking, no lags whatsoever
  <br/>
  15. Out of the box - Android Lollipop
  <br/>
  16. 16GB internal storage (5gb system reserved)
  <br/>
  17. Option to move non-system apps and games to SD card
  <br/>
  18. Superb and lag free gaming experience (Tested with Asphalt 8, Dead Trigger 2, Batman Arkham Origins, FIFA 14, GTA Vice City)
  <br/>
  19. Dual Sim 4G phone
  <br/>
  20. USB OTG support
  <br/>
  21. All major sensors included
  <br/>
  22. ASUS view FLIP cover support.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Biggest PRO: Asus Zen UI. Just amazing. And the only custom UI which I've liked till now, with features like
  <br/>
  1. Gesture Support
  <br/>
  2. Themes support
  <br/>
  3. Amazing power saver modes built in. Hats off to the ASUS software, which gives the best battery life ever.
  <br/>
  4. Built in APP LOCKER and APP Backup
  <br/>
  5. Autostart manager - To prevent apps from running in the background, hence making the phone faster.
  <br/>
  6. One hand mode
  <br/>
  7. Timely updates to all ASUS apps.
  <br/>
  8. Glove mode - To make the touch super sensitive
  <br/>
  9. Can change display properties like Hue, Saturation, etc.
  <br/>
  10. Built in quick task cleaner, Calculator, Flashlight, Quick Memo
  <br/>
  11. Easy mode for elderly people
  <br/>
  12. Smart grouping of apps in App Drawer
  <br/>
  13. Amazing photo and video editor built-in
  <br/>
  14. PC Link and Remote Link for remote controlling PC from phone and vice versa built-in
  <br/>
  15. Themes and customization support for the keyboard
  <br/>
  16. Customizable quick toggles
  <br/>
  17. Fonts support
  <br/>
  18. Automatic call recorder
  <br/>
  19. Icon packs support
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons:
  <br/>
  There's literally no con with this device, it is the perfect budget phone.
  <br/>
  Only nitpicking if I have to do would be the low speak output on smart mode, which can be solved using the audio manager
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall the best phone u can buy under 10k. I have recommended this phone to 5 of my frnds after I purchased and all of them have liked it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Thank You ASUS and Thank You Flipkart

  Zenfone 2 laser has its perks, but the most irritating issue is that the on call dialer is unusable because whatever you do, you can't get the screen on during a call.
  <br/>
  Not a proximity sensor issue, while on a call screen just blacks out and
  <br/>
  stops responding whatever you do. So far I have found out its a more than common
  <br/>
  problem with ZE550KL model and boils down to faulty in-built firmware.
  <br/>

  I have used its Zenfone 5 model earlier which was good in other departments except poor battery and heat up issue while gaming and charging. But after reading reviews on good battery life, I bought Zenfone 2 Laser.

  Glad to share that my decision was right as with regular whatsapp/facebook/calls/sms use and normal gaming, my phone's battery is lasting to almost 24 hours which is very very good with comparison to other competitors mobiles.

Review Title : Disappointed with Rear Camera quality.

Upvotes : 20

Downvotes : 10

Review Content :

  ASUS has come up with the BEST smartphone phablet ever i can say.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pros:
  <br/>
  First thing to mention is Zen UI. Came bundled with many display setting options. 2 gb ram is excellent and it's super fast. Almost 800-900mb is free.Was Able to play all high end games with out any Lag(Dead Trigger 2, Riptide etc).. It has a descent rear camera and a good front camera. One thing to mention there are whole lot of photograph setting but the rear camera losses its charm as the picture taken are a little grainy. Display is mind blowing. Even though it's of 5.5", it fits perfectly in my hand. Looks very premium and classy. Charges very fast compared to Lenovo K3. A full charge has given me one and half day, while it was either connected to wi-fi or working on 3G and playing games.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons:
  <br/>
  Volume level is a little low. Rear camera quality is descent, but fully packed with many picture settings. Can be felt a little over weight. Power button is at the top, a little difficult to reach but due to the double tap on the screen to awake and sleep option, you don't feel like using the power button.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  But considering how sexy and good it feels in my hand, it's worth every penny.

  I had bought Lenove K3 note, but after 1 week one day phone got heated so much and touch sensor on some parts of screen started giving problem. I called flipkart for replacement. But as K3 not was out of stock they could not give replacement and they debited Rs.9999 to my flipkart wallet account on same day when they took by defective K3 note. Very Very happy with the Flipkart service after purchasing product which makes me to keep shopping in Flipkart than any other online store.
  <br/>
  With Rs. 9999 wallet i ordered Asus Zenfone 2 Laser and have been using since last 3 weeks.
  <br/>
  Pros

  1. Good battery backup. As I use to download PC games in torrent, i always keep my wifi on in mobile and download through torrent. Believe me, with wifi on always it gives 24 hours of battery backup. As I had used K3 note earlier, for my experience K3 was giving hardly 6 hours backup with wifi always on
  <br/>
  2. Supports memory card upto 128GB, but presently i am using 64GB card to download high end games. But K3 note supported only 32GB which i was not able to download heavy size games.
  <br/>
  3. Laser Auto focus  for quick focus on objects.
  <br/>
  4. Has inbuilt application to control apps on start up which boosts device performance.
  <br/>
  5. Has double tap feature to wake up the screen and also to lock it. K3 note doesnt have application control and double tap feature
  <br/>
  6. On first boot I get 1GB of free RAM, but in K3 note you get 600-700MB free ram on first boot.
  <br/>
  7. After 8- 10 hours of first boot (i mean opening closing many applications) there will be always 700-800mb free RAM, But K3 note will have 300-400mb RAM
  <br/>
  8. With inbuilt Asus Audio Wizard and Google Music Equalizer it produces awesome sound effect with heavy Bass ( I am using Creative EP630). I feel like I am inside theatre while listening to Music. Even Lenovo K3 note has Atom Dolby, but it doesnt allows you to customize equalizer at all and it doesnt work together with google music equalizer. In K3 either you have to use Atom Dolby or Goole music Equalizer. But Asus gives option to use both Audio Wizard and Google Music Equalizer which produces thumping Bass. After hearing sound effect of Asus, I kept my Sony MP3 Player in my drawer
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons
  <br/>
  1. Bit uncomfortable to operate in one hand as it is 5.5 inch screen
  <br/>
  2. Screen is HD but still its look good in bright sunlight. I didnt find any difference between Full HD of K3 note and HD of this mobile
  <br/>
  3. Didnt like the inbuilt messaging application, but K3 not has good and nice messaging application in which has option to pinch in zoom in messaging app
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you are thinking to go with K3 note or Asus Zenfone 2 Laser, by my experience i suggest you to go for Asus.

  Thanks for quick delivery from Flipkart got it on 30th Aug. itself. Phone is operating very smoothly, Excellent touch, fabulous design, vast screen, also pretty sleek. Camera is fantastic, No lagging, Battery Backup very good. Also one can use all the slots avail. Only one drawback is Sound quality which is bit low, but overall I would def. suggest to for this one if anyone is planning to buy phone under 10K. Far better than Lenovo K3 Note.

Review Title : ZENFONE 2 LASER ZE550KL - ABSOLUTE PAISA VASOOL!

Upvotes : 22

Review Content :
ss="">
  1st of all, ignore all the fellows who have been complaining of poor camera quality, poor sound quality, poor battery quality and all that. These guys do not know anything about how to use a smartphone like Asus Zenfone Laser (AZL).
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2ndly, I honestly don't see any CONS in this phone, especially at this price.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  - I tweaked the sound through Audi Wizard and it played a fabulous output on the speakers and through the earphones.
  <br/>
  - I played around with the camera settings and I got pictures that would compare favourably with a decent camera. Even in low light i got images that were not at all grainy.
  <br/>
  - Someone complained that the front camera came without a video shooting facility. I corrected that by downloading "Open Camera" application from Google Play Store.
  <br/>
  - The ZenUI makes it a pleasure to use. Everything I want is at a touch of a button.
  <br/>
  - There is not lag, no drag - nothing.
  <br/>
  - I do not play games, but my research on youtube.com showed me that this phones handles most games very nicely.
  <br/>
  - Transition between screens and applications is pure "maska".
  <br/>
  - I have downloaded more than 50+ apps and yet at most times I have more than 700MB RAM free.
  <br/>
  - Although the phone is 170 gms, it feels light, sleek and easy to hold.
  <br/>
  - Even though the phone is 5.5 inches, The "one hand operations" feature enables a person with small hands to work with the phone using only one hand.
  <br/>
  - The phone allows 2 Micro SIM cards and 1 microSD card. so all three have exclusive slots.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  So, just buy this phone!!! You will be delighted to own it.

Review Title : Started on good note

Upvotes : 11

Review Content :
ss="">
  I have LG L9 Optimus, 4.7'' screen which is 125 gm and using since last 3 years, it started giving problem after i had to get the screen change after it was broken, else i am very happy to be content with L9.
  <br/>
  So, after lots of ground work ordered Moto 3rd Gen. But then also saw that Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE550KL was tailing Moto in all review, most of the place First rank is Moto and second goes to Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE550KL. Now, since, long battery life is more important to me, i cancelled Moto and pre-ordered Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE550KL.
  <br/>
  Flipkart committed for 3rd week of Sept'15 but got it delivered on 28th Aug, well this was WOW...
  <br/>
  First look , Just a look, OKKKK,
  <br/>
  Then i hold it in my hand and ehhhhhh, it looses compare to L9 Due to big size and being heavy...
  <br/>
  But then i thought, its not Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE550KL problem, i brought it consciously.
  <br/>
  Now come to Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE550KL, the fone look good and sturdy. For me Camera is good as i do not expect it to give me DSLR (I am learning photography with DSLR) like quality. Night shots are good (compare to LG Optimus) .
  <br/>
  The best part in last 36 hours of usage is it does not heat up as much as LG Optimus and battery is awesome, yesterday i was on 4G full day and the i did not have to charge the fone entire day.
  <br/>
  i haven't seen other other features but all in all satisfied.
  <br/>
  An update as of today the 20th Sept'15:
  <br/>
  Yesterday, all of sudden front camera stopped working. I did trouble shooting by starting fone in safe mode, no help. Did factory reset, no help.
  <br/>
  finally requested for replacement.
  <br/>
  Kudos to professionalism of Flipkart, the called sharp on time as committed. They did some basic check and offered me refund or replacement.
  <br/>
  Since i am happy with product i chose replacement.
  <br/>
  I am very happy with Flipkart and product ...... most striking feature of fone is the battery and it does not get heated.... both of which i value most...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  An update @ 21st Sept, 10.55 am :
  <br/>
  Got the replacement within 24 hours.... wonderful..... full mark for cust sat...
  <br/>
  Now time to watch... hope this time , i will have seamless functioning

  <br/>
  2)Os and UI interface are quite vibrant,feels much better than my earlier samsung
  <br/>
  3)Touch is very responsive
  <br/>
  4) I didn't find any lags, rather it is quite fast
  <br/>
  5)Camera is pretty decent,especially the front camera.Although i did find some noise in images.
  <br/>
  6) Battery life is excellent
  <br/>
  7)Mic,speaker(voice),Signal strength are good
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I did'nt like
  <br/>
  1)Video playback is poor.Understandable due to poor pixel density
  <br/>
  2)Video recording is substandard
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall if someone is looking for a good budget phone with above positive features,then this is a must buy.

Review Title : Nice Phone With Good Battery Backup...

Review Content :
ss="">
  Thanks Flipkart For Fast Re - shipment of my order...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Now come to the Phone...
  <br/>
  It's Just Awesome... There some Pros. and Cons.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pros:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. Built Quality- Really nice quality phone. Look Awesome, comfortable on hand while using.
  <br/>
  2. Screen - Corning Gorilla 4 Glass 5.5 Inch Screen, Crisp and clear quality. Really Touch sensitive. Brightness of screen is also good.
  <br/>
  3. Performance - While using internet via wi-fi and 3g, it's smooth. No lag find while using apps.
  <br/>
  4. Audio- Really too good Audio Quality while playing music. Advanced features - Bass and Treble Control and Equalizer.
  <br/>
  5. Battery - Battery Backup is just Awesome. You'll really love it. It takes little more time for charging, But it's ok.
  <br/>
  6. UI - Really nice theme, and there also available lots of theme. Color Combination is good, Nice Icons.
  <br/>
  7. Heating - I didn't find any heating issue with this phone while using internet, charging, using apps and playing games. Pretty Good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Con:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1. Camera - Both Rear and Front camera not giving good Quality in all types of mode. Too much grainy, and low quality Images, Little Disappointed. But it's ok, I didn't buy this Phone only for Camera. And when saving photo it's taking little more time, Don't know why.
  <br/>
  2. Gaming - This phone is not for gaming at all. Lagging too much while playing normal games like - Subway Surfer, Asphalt 8 etc... Really Disappointed, Phone have Snapdragon 410 CPU , Adreno 306 Gpu, 2 GB Ram. Still too much Lagging.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  <br/>
  <br/>
  At last i want to just say, if you looking for good Camera phone and gaming phone, Don't buy this.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  This Phone is Awesome in Battery Backup, Looks, Screen Quality, Internet Browsing, Apps Performance, no heating issue...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  And i love this Phone, Bcz i've no addiction of gaming and taking pics...

Review Title : Awesomeness from Asus

Upvotes : 5

Downvotes : 1

Review Content :
ss="">
  First of Delivery:
  <br/>
  Flipkart was prompt and delivery was good as usual..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  About the Product:
  <br/>
  I bought ZE550KL White
  <br/>
  Design:
  <br/>
  Mobile could be bought blindly for its design. Looks and feel are of a high end phone (not an exaggeration). Design is solid and doesnt look like it has a plastic back cover even though
  <br/>
  it has(thanks to texture type of back cover-matte). Most important is that it is actually sleek and that too near the ends...It just feels amazing to hold it..A bit low side in the design is its weight but thats bearable when its sleekness is considered.
  <br/>
  A quite larger phone due to 5.5 inch display...Its some what difficult for me hold but thats not going to be same for others too....
  <br/>
  Specs:
  <br/>
  A more than decent specs.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Working:
  <br/>
  First of all.....touch is butter smooth and it doesnt feel like we are handling a heavy phone...Touch response is the reason for making us feel the 'phone using' part as light.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No backlit keys....not a problem...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Ram available is around 600 to 700 MB...looks less on paper but the performance hardly sucks....
  <br/>
  <br/>
  A bit of hanging here and there initially but now thats all gone....
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Performance is far better from whats written in many reviews across many websites...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Zen UI-- is one the crown jewels of this phone...Most user friendly and most responsive.
  <br/>
  Colorful wallpapers and icon packs and scroll effects and different themes gives you a plenty of combinations to try with so that we dont get bored looking onto the same display for a long period..Task bar from the top provides you the most needed launches and settings in one go and fortunately it could be altered to your preferences...
  <br/>
  Do it later, Prompting reminders, Whats next features comes in handy and makes your device very productive...Zen UI features are many and will amuse you continuously..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Camera- Primary camera is good indoors and outdoors as well. Initially i felt worried about the camera quality after reading some reviews but after experiencing first hand reviews proved wrong since the gadget reviewers always review it with many other competitors in mind and in result of that they fail to realize the quality of the product in its own space...
  <br/>
  Front camera was bit problematic in my device..I decided to let it go (instead replacing) since am not a selfie guy..I prefer features and ease of handling the phone and its productivity...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Memory-User memory is 10 GB and it comes lot of preloaded apps which we can uninstall we if we dont need them....Exapandle memory too..
  <br/>
  Most preloaded apps cant be moved to sdcard...A bit disappointing...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Display- Some of the reviews mentioned it as big let down...But to my surprise its superb..Great clarity in display and mainly it has blue light filter...
  <br/>
  A phone below 10k range with this display quality becomes unquestionable...
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Battery-
  <br/>
  Another crown jewel..3000 mah battery is more than what a heavy user will ask for..
  <br/>
  With full time wi-fi on and 1 hour and more of call time and still many hours of meddling the phone with games etc doesnt drain the phone compared to other models with same specs...Some nice battery saving features are there and Battery life extender module
  <br/>
  enhances the battery life really.
  <br/>
  Since my first full charge it is going to nearly 20 hrs and still battery shows '35 % and approx 6 hrs left'....Another point to be noted is there is no need to charge it for 8 hours before your first use as many tell and also Asus mentions it in its manual. its a myth and however some decent battery charging habits have to developed (study it from internet)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Music- Music player is let down in this model..
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sensors- all sensors are working fine including proximity sensor. i mentioned it because some had problems in their devices reg their proximity sensors.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Verdict- A very very Good phone with very minor let downs as mentioned above...
  <br/>
  But really a worth tying one...
  <br/>
  I had satisfaction of ending up buying a superb phone at this rate that satisfies me what a high end phone could provide to its buyer..
  <br/>
  Really i mean it since i had bought this device after a lot of research and and reviews and some tough decisions...after all this hardship had it been a let down phone then.....
  <br/>
  Actually i am on cloud nine for buying this device....

Review Title : Better than any other phone within 10 k

Upvotes : 5

Review Content :
ss="">
  This phone is the best budget phone within 10k. I've been using this phone for 2 days from now,So here are my like and dislike about this phone.
  <br/>
  What i Like:
  <br/>
  1. 5.5 inch screen although its not a FHD but the display resolution is good.
  <br/>
  2. Battery backup is decent it will last upto 24 hours for an average usage.
  <br/>
  3. ZenUI is the best UI which is user friendly and easy to operate.
  <br/>
  4. Camera is decent although is not what i've expect from a 13 Mp with pixelmaster but it capture good photo in the daylight, there is alot of features &amp; option in the camera like panorama shoot, low light, manual, etc. &amp; Laser is working fine.
  <br/>
  5. It came with the Latest Gorilla Glass 4,which is the latest scratch resistance glass.
  <br/>
  6. Dual Sim which both support 4G but it doesn't support Volte.
  <br/>
  What i dont Like:
  <br/>
  1. 1.2 quad core which is little disappoint for multi tasking but till now i dont find any lag.
  <br/>
  2. charging its taking too long.
  <br/>
  But overall Asus Zenfone 2 Laser is the best phone in the sub 10k budget, its better than other phone in this price range like Xiomi Note 4G, Yu Yureka Plus, Lenovo K3 Note &amp; Moto G.

  I ordered this phone on 7th March 2016 at 2:30 AM and received on 8th March at around 9:30 AM. This really awesome phone. Those who are expecting better camera,they should buy a DSLR separately. The camera of this phone is more then enough at this price range. Great display, smooth multi-tasking and obviously great design. Go for this phone. You will not get better phone,other than this in this price range. After Marshmallow update the camera has improved more. Already 7 months passed , I am very happy with this phone.

  have pre ordered this phone and I must mention that overall order fulfillment and delivery of Flipkart is very good. When I used this phone some departments the phone is very good and in some it's just average or below average.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1- Phone has got good body...  (4/5)
  <br/>
  2- Battery backup is very good (4.2/5)
  <br/>
  3- 2 GB ram phone is superfast. (4/5)
  <br/>
  4-Sound (4/5) (No Stereo speakers but its loud and clear )
  <br/>
  5  5.5 inch IPS Display with Corning Gorilla Glass 4 feels great (4.2/5)
  <br/>
  5- The  rear camera quality is  not good like 13MP. Front camera is okay 3/5...
  <br/>
  6- Processor is good 4/5

Review Title : Bad Quality

  I wanted to write a review of this product after using for at least one month. and by the time I was about to write a review one incident happened with me. which I will tell you later.
  <br/>
  Lets go through the Pros
  <br/>
  Phone is good, with endless customization options. You can customize any thing from Icon Size, font to background color of most of the Pre-loaded app.
  <br/>
  Automatic grouping icon is also a good feature and widgets etc.
  <br/>
  I have not played the games, but some times I get the warning on launcher not responding.. which easily goes once u click on wait option.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Looks good with fine finish.
  <br/>
  Configuration is good and camera clarity excellent, which is problem in most of the other phones in this price range. One of my Japanese colleague told me that this phone is among the popular phones in Japan.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  <br/>
  My mobile fell from my bed while I was charging. and the screen broke. ( note : corning Gorilla Glass 4). When I looked for the screen on google, it was found that all ASUS Zenphone have a very week screen and lots of complaint raised world wide, to improve the quality since 2013, but the company is giving it a blind eye. some people have complaint that the screen use to broke even with the tempered glass. Mos of the people complaining said that their screen broke when it fall from knee height.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  I brought this phone for xxxx which some of you would have purchased at 8999 on Big app day with additional of 10%% discount on some credit card.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  When i inquired the service center for the replacing cost of screen, I was told 6000 + change. and this is pissing me off!!!! how they can ask for 6K plus for the phone available at such a low price.
  <br/>
  Very high spare part price.

Review Title : Baap of all Mid Range Phones!!!!

Upvotes : 5

Review Content :
ss="">
  I've recieved this mobile 2 days back....1 day ahead of sheduled date of delivery(kudos to Flipkart!!)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  and now coming to the phone....It is just awesome..It offers you everything that you expect from a smartphone.It delivers you a smooth experience,no heating issues whatsoever and never lags at all.The battery is just mind blowing,it gives you an battery back up of 2 days which is just unbelievable from a smartphone of this size.Asus engineers have done a great job in optimising this phone well.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Infact,it is much better than the moto g3,mi 4i,lenovo k3 note,samsung j7
  <br/>
  <br/>
  moto g3-- costs 3k bucks higher than the zenfone 2 laser,smaller 5 inch display,stock android experience,customization is not possible,lesser battery life and poor camera performance compared to zenfone 2 laser.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  mi4i-- costs 3k higher,but expandable memory card slot is not available which is a very big con
  <br/>
  <br/>
  lenovo k3 note-- costs same as zenfone2 laser but has major heating issues in it because of the snapdragon 615 chipset which is not suitable for indian conditions.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  samsung j7-- costs 5k higher than zenfone 2 laser,misses out a lot of important sensors like the auto brightness sensor,compass sensor,gyroscope.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Initially,I was totally confused about which one to select from the above 5 phones.But then,i have seen a lot of review videos and finally came to the conclusion that Asus zenfone 2 laser is the Best of all....
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Though the phone costs 10k,it costs a lot more than 10k.Ultimately,it is an awesome value for money package...Guys..dont keep any second thoughts...blindly go for it.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  ASUS...why did u price it so less,u should have priced it 2k higher....you are missing out lot of profits... :p

Review Title : The All rounder with no Marketing gimmicks ...

Upvotes : 5

Downvotes : 2

Review Content :
ss="">
  Been using this device for over a month now. What really made me buy this device was the non heating seamless performance that it provides over its competitors like Yureka Plus,K3 Note etc. This device has shortcomings, but it's optimised and has quality in whatever specs it has to offer. Somewhat like Moto G3.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Pros:
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Display(premium quality,CG4 protection), wished it was FHD,but then the SD 410 processor will struggle with performance and the battery will be reduced substantially.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Battery: It lasts long for a phablet &amp; on most occasions even gave better life than smaller screen devices. On screen time was somewhere around 6.5-7 hours. Stand by time is excellent due to Zen UI.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Performance: Most tasks are smooth and fluid. The device is able to handle almost all apps &amp; games what one would install.Even big games handled well with no lags like Asphalt 8,Dead Trigger 2 etc .It's not a graphic intensive device in the price range and no device in this segment plays extremely high graphics games, especially without heating. This device has negligible heating even while charging and using the device simultaneously.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Camera: On most occasions, the camera did give good to average pics(especially with ample light). One should be adept in using different modes according to the conditions though.Although,digital noise in artificial light conditions &amp; dark conditions are more than one would want to see. Personally,I expected a bit more from the camera, as the phone has its name dedicated to it.Moto G3 has a much better camera,but then it costs more too. Don't get me wrong, the camera is good for the price range under 10 &amp; can compete against competitors like Yurekas and k3 notes but it just doesn't punch out in this category like it does in battery, feel, build, display,smoothness, software, less heating issues etc. Laser focus works mostly , however the end image could have been better with low light support. Selfie camera is good enough &amp; gives good wide panorama Selfies. Not spectacular, but it edges out the competitions due to better software algorithms.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Software: Zen UI is much better than Vibe UI. The support is fantastic. Any bugs, lags, manufacturer's apps are always having updates regularly and works like a charm on most occasions. Most apps will not let you feel the need of 3rd party apps.It is optimized for the specs on the device to enhance the battery and performance. Fortunately, it's not like other custom UI's which claim to optimise the software but isn't of much use in real life. Although Android upgrades are yet to be seen.ASUS is known to give updates to its devices albeit taking a bit of time.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Sound: Trust me, most people have bad reviews for sound but it's output is ample. To put into perspective, it had much more volume than Galaxy S5, Canvas 5,Moto G2 etc.It just needs a few tweaks in audio fx manager. Gaming mode amplifies the sound two folds! The acoustics don't snap or break and is clear. It's not boom sound or anything but it's more than enough for a small room.I don't expect a 10k phone to give audio outputs which will be glass shattering. If one needs then pair it with a Bluetooth speaker, like I do. Earphones &amp; headphones output is excellent too.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Cons :
  <br/>
  <br/>
  The biggest con I can think of is the fact, that this device doesn't have any marketing stand out feature. Yes, all its qualities are good or above average but it just doesn't make a cut which you can claim astonishingly.For e.g. k3 note got famous due to FHD screen,Yureka due to cyanogen and OP1 like above category specs in budget segment etc.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  One can say, it takes time to charge, camera isn't out of the league, Speakers need software support, headsets should have been included etc etc as its con. However these are not any inconveniences. It's just nitpicking(which every smartphone will have in the budget segment).But this device in real life performance is just exponential in terms of pure looks, feel,usage &amp; value for money.One would not miss FHD screen or lack of power under the hood. Camera is more than decent with LAF. Doesn't lag or subdues performance with heating issues. Gives ample audio output with almost all apps running seamlessly. Battery life is good and furthur enhanced by software. Updates are systematic and ASUS is dedicated to it.All its characteristics and specs just Coincide to give the user the most joyful experience. Really a worthy product and VFM. Go for it without hesitation if you need a bigger screen than Moto G3 with a lesser price tag &amp; don't mind using custom UI's.

  Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE550KL
  <br/>
  I pre booked this phone on 4th sept ..advance paid
  <br/>
  It was mentioned by the seller that tentative release of this phone is 16th sep and delivery will be done by 21st or 23rd but the best part is that i got this sexy zenfone on 15th sept.
  <br/>
  1- Phone looks sexy - black colour
  <br/>
  curved ,sleek,handy,cool big,
  <br/>
  2- Touch is fab..no lagg
  <br/>
  3- camera is descent ..front selfe camera is amazingly good with auto beauty correction features.
  <br/>
  best part is ..you dont have to put the power key everytime to wake up your phone.
  <br/>
  just tap on screen ..it will open his eyes and tap again will close lol=))
  <br/>
  4- android lollipop is amazing with cool themes
  <br/>
  gesture controls are amazing
  <br/>
  5-Excellent battery life- seriously you will love this. stays alert for 2 days once charged full
  <br/>
  6-Gaming performance is good..asphalt 8 runs smoothly
  <br/>
  6-Speaker output is lil weak as compared to other phones in similar price.
  <br/>
  You need to adjust the bass,treble and volume to make it little louder.
  <br/>
  but it is very much okay..i dont want an amplifier in my hand
  <br/>
  If you add these two things in the box you will be able to create an additional smile on buyers face
  <br/>
  - NO Earphones
  <br/>
  - No temporary screen guard

  Pros:
  <br/>
  Ok display the brightness is not that much great but colors are good and there is bluelight filter which is very good for reading. with kindle app it is as good as kindle with bluelight filter.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Good battery but takes looong time to charge
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No heating when playing games or while charging
  <br/>
  <br/>
  OK Camera for low light - still the picture is granular
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Camera tools are good and very quick to focus under a scan we can focus and click
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Good build qualitys unlike a6000 plus lenovo it is not flipmsy
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Has proximity and campass and other sensors
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Good sound through headphone (no head phone provided)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Only speaker is not that great and it is on bottom of the phone behind so for call with speaker it is not that great and sound you can feel that it is away from you. With this type of screen and bazel size i expected the speaker to be on front or atleast two speakers.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  No backlight for home and other buttons but double tap to wakup is there so not a big issue

Review Title : A good budget phone but have some serious issues!!!

  I have purchased this phone 15 days back. Initially, I was rather happy to have made a good selection as the phone has really stylish looks and great features. But, then I encountered a serious issue...Every time I make a call, the screen blacks out and does not wake up inspite of double tapping the screen! It takes about half a min to wake up. During this period, I am unable to operate the phone. And, I must say this is really irritating!
  <br/>
  Also, the phone starts lagging after installing 10-12 applications.
  <br/>
  I think Asus should really resolve this issue soon!
  <br/>
  Apart from this, the phone has really good features, a great battery and the Customized Zen UI is really smooth and easy to use....

  Asus Zenfone 2 Laser ZE550KL (Black, 16 GB)
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Things to Note ( Given the proce of the mobile at 8.999 Rs )
  <br/>
  <br/>
  1) Display: Even in bright sunlight and display at 70-80%.. Viewing the display isnt much of a issue.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  2) Sound:  External speakers at the back do a great job.  Output  for music played is clear and excellent
  <br/>
  Call quality: very clear and audible even in traffic and outdoors
  <br/>
  <br/>
  3) Camera: this is the high point of this mobile given its a budget price bracket mob.
  <br/>
  The various modes given in the Asus camera software is brilliant. Specially the manual mode to change the   ISO / focus and so on.
  <br/>
  Low light photos taken indoor: tested the flash in complete darkness at a 10 feet distance: Brilliant  results
  <br/>
  Outdoor night pictures were good with very low noise or distortion  ( With zoom at max there is bound to be distortion in any mobile
  <br/>
  at this price range).. The low light mode is very good.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  4) Battery : The 3,000 mAh easily holds up for a day with wifi on 24 hrs and moderate calling  and internet usage. ( try  clean background apps every now and then to help save
  <br/>
  batt ). The RAM clean up software is a welcome addition
  <br/>
  Absolutly no heating issues when charging ( i use a 2.1 A  charger )
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Overall, Its backed by a solid  build quality  and gorilla glass 3.  Clean design and  has a simple smart appeal.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  For this price range,  Asus has got it spot on. A perfect all rounder  with everything in it.

Review Title : Voice call Quality not Good

Review Content :

  Bought it after reading the reviews on flipkart and was really disappointed. Will never buy anything just by going with its reviews.
  <br/>
  I have checked the voice call clarity many times and its not working even with airtel sim and all the excuse they got is network issues.
  <br/>
  That sim works fine with other phones, but with this one, voice breaks during the call.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  Otherwise other features are working good, camera specification is exaggerated, but its good for 10k and touch and battery till now is working fine.
  <br/>
  <br/>
  If you ignore the basic call feature of a phone, then this phn is 4/5, but in my case I cant ignore it at all. Because, phone is for calling, dat cant be compromised.
